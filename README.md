## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### Used techniques:

- BEM
- Accessibility

But created with :heart:

### What I learned

I have learned javaScript charting library Chart.js. It was a new experience for me. Data was fetched and destructured from data.json file and chart object was instantiated to get chart dynamically.

### Continued development

- [FM project:](https://github.com/Darionas/interactive-comments-section)

### Useful resources

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for the modern web.
